# Dogs-of-New-York
Exercise for Students

Through building Flexdasboards in R, the students will have the opportunity to learn more about R programming environment. 

Apart from Flexdashboard (**Dogs of New York.Rmd** and **Dogs-of-New-York.html** file), the folder includes reveal.js presentation with step by step instructions for this exercise (**Testhtmlpres.Rmd** and **Testhtmlpres.html** file), as well as accompanying images and gifs. You can find the presentation at the following [link](https://tixwitchy.github.io/Dogs-of-New-York/Testhtmlpres.html#/). This excercise is targetting students and beginners who did not have previous experience in using R programming language, as well as, anyone who did not use this package before. 

The data used for the exercise is slightly reduced version of a **nyc_bites** dataset available in **nycdogs** package by Kieran Healy.
